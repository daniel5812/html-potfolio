<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Daniel Dahan, a dedicated and ambitious computer science student with a passion for solving
   complex problems through innovative solutions.
   Welcome to my portfolio,
    where I'll be sharing
     my journey and showcasing the projects and skills
      I've developed during my first year in the Computer
       Science B.S.C program.</p>

<p>During my exciting academic journey,
   I've dived into the foundations of computer science,
   laying a strong groundwork through courses like Object-Oriented Programming
    in Java, Linear Algebra 1 and 2, Calculus, Combinatorics, and Computer Architecture.
     These subjects have not only broadened my horizons but have also fueled my curiosity
      to explore the diverse and ever-evolving world of computer science.</p>
